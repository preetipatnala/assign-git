• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

A gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. Generally, it is placed in the root folder of the repository, but we can place it in any repository and we can have multiple gitignore files.
Files that can be included for a java project are :
target	
.settings	
.DS_Store	
MANIFEST.MF	
.idea	
*.iml	
*.jar	
*.war	
*.zip	
*.tar	
.classpath	
.project	
.class	
.log	
	
	

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?

If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch.This is called fast forward.

The master branch has the original code which is safe and will not be manipulated.
